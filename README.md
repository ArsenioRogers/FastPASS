# FastPASS
 
Created a password generator that enables employees to generate random yet secure passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.
 
 
* Verified that a series of prompts for password criteria runs when user clicks the button to generate a password.

* Created ability for user to select which criteria to include in the password

* Set length parameters of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

* Created option for user to decide whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

* Verified that at least one character type must be selected

* After all prompts are answered a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

* Once the password is generated it's written to the page
